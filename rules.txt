- HOW TO PLAY -

At its core, Touhou Yahtzee behaves like regular Yahtzee. The name of the game is 
to score as many points as you can.

Each turn, you have 3 rolls, after which you select the best score to fit the 
hand you have. Once you pick a score, it cannot be used again for that game. Once 
all of the possible scores have been used up, the game is over and your final score 
is presented.

- POTENTIAL SCORES -

Aces to Sixes: Simply counts the number of cards in your deck and multiplies it 
                by that number. For example, 2 sixes would be worth 12 points.
Large Straight: Consecutive numbers (ie: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or A, 2, 3, 4 ,5). They can be 
                 in any order, however.
Small Straight: Similar to large straight, but you only need 4 numbers.
Full House: This is when you have 3 of the same number, and 2 of another number.
Four of a kind: Holding 4 of the same card yields points based on 4 multiplied by 
                 the value of the card.
Three of a kind: Same as Four of a kind, but with 3 matches instead.
Yata!: When all 5 cards are the same.
Spellcard: Similar to "chance" in regular Yahtzee. It simply adds up everything in your 
           hand and converts it to points. You can reset the spellcard by
           creating x3 combos, which just means getting 3 consecutive scores worth more than 0 points.
